### **Champion-Challenger Testing Framework for ETL Jobs: On-Prem vs. Cloud**

This automation framework is designed to ensure the output parity between an on-premises **Ab Initio-based ETL batch system** and a cloud-based ETL platform hosted on AWS. By automating the validation process, the framework allows for seamless comparison of outputs, ensuring that the new platform delivers results consistent with the current system. The framework supports champion-challenger testing by treating the on-premises system as the "champion" and the AWS platform as the "challenger."

#### **Framework Workflow**

1. **Identify Input Dataset for Validation**  
   - Analyze and select the appropriate dataset for the ETL job under comparison.  
   - Gather metadata such as file names, schema definitions, and dependencies from both systems.  
   - Define validation scope (e.g., specific jobs or workflows).

2. **Automate Data Transfer to AWS**  
   - **Objective**: Transfer input files from the on-premises system to AWS.  
   - **Steps**:  
     - Use **Managed File Transfer (MFT)** tools to automate the transfer process.  
     - Accept dynamic inputs like file name, source location (on-prem file system), and destination S3 bucket.  
     - Ensure logging and retry mechanisms for reliability.  
   - **Output**: The input files are stored in the designated AWS S3 bucket for the new platform.

3. **Automate Data Onboarding to Cloud Workflow**  
   - Develop **UI automation scripts** (using tools like Selenium or Cypress) to onboard the input data into the cloud platform.  
   - Ensure the uploaded data is tagged and registered appropriately for the solution workflow to access it.  
   - Validate the successful completion of the onboarding process via logs or UI confirmation messages.

4. **Execute Solution Workflow on AWS**  
   - Automate the execution of the cloud-based ETL job through the platform's UI or API.  
   - Simulate the batch workload of the original on-premises system by triggering the equivalent workflow.  
   - Validate the job's completion using execution logs or dashboard status.

5. **Collect Output from AWS (S3-Output Bucket)**  
   - The new platform's output files are stored in a predefined **S3-Output** bucket.  
   - Archive logs and metadata for each job run for traceability.

6. **Generate Output from On-Prem System**  
   - Run the original ETL job on the Ab Initio system using the same input dataset.  
   - Validate successful completion and collect output files.

7. **Transfer On-Prem Output to AWS (S3-Validate Bucket)**  
   - Automate the transfer of on-premises output files to an **S3-Validate** bucket on AWS.  
   - Ensure the same folder structure, naming conventions, and metadata as the S3-Output bucket.

8. **Compare Output Files**  
   - Use a data comparison tool or custom scripts to validate parity between files in the **S3-Output** and **S3-Validate** buckets.  
   - Implement the following checks:
     - **Schema Validation**: Ensure column names and data types match.  
     - **Data Integrity**: Verify that row counts, null values, and data ranges align.  
     - **File Checksums**: Use hash functions (e.g., MD5) to ensure byte-level equivalence.

#### **Key Tools and Technologies**
- **AWS Services**: S3 for storage, Lambda for triggers, and Glue for data preparation.
- **Ab Initio**: On-premises ETL jobs.
- **MFT Platform**: For secure file transfer.
- **UI Automation Tools**: Selenium or Cypress for automating UI interactions.
- **Comparison Tools**: Great Expectations, AWS Athena, or Python libraries like Pandas and difflib for data validation.
- **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow or AWS Step Functions for workflow automation.

#### **Advantages of the Framework**
- **End-to-End Automation**: Reduces manual effort by automating input dataset preparation, workflow execution, and validation.  
- **Consistency**: Ensures both systems are compared under identical conditions, improving accuracy.  
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets and complex workflows seamlessly.  
- **Integration**: Easily integrates with existing CI/CD pipelines for continuous validation during migration.  
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed logs for debugging mismatches and identifying system discrepancies.
