{"body":"&gt;  i can only repeat that contrary to what you're assuming, you do need explicit permission to alter the author's license offer\r\n\r\nAnd I can only repeat that there is not some magical \"license offer\" document here, and that modifying the file as permitted by one of the licenses does not constitute \"re-licensing\", does not constitute \"removing the license\" and does not constitute \"changing the license\". The license under which you received the software was one of:\r\n\r\n1. The BSD license, or\r\n2. The GNU GPL, version 2.\r\n\r\nNo other terms can apply. No other restrictions can apply. The only terms which apply are those of the license you accept.\r\n\r\nAgain: read what I've written about the consequences of this. The barest minimum consequence which can come out of your argument is that, despite the offer of GPL, it's not legal for anyone to distribute the software under GPL; your magical immutable license offer which must be passed on would constitute a restriction not present in the terms of the GPL, and thus any GPL distributor who passes on a requirement to preserve it would breach the GPL in so doing.\r\n\r\nThe further consequence of this would be that it is not possible for _any_ piece of software, originally offered under a choice of BSD or GPL by the author, to be legally distributed under the GPL by any licensee.\r\n\r\nAre you truly arguing for, and prepared to accept, that consequence? Or are you willing to step back and realize that this contradiction with actual reality -- where it _is_ possible to dual license and distribute under either offered license -- points to a problem in the concept of the magically immutable license offer?","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_2ug2z","stickied":false,"subreddit":"programming","score":1,"ups":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1191196824,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"ubernostrum","id":"c2v6ro","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_c2v6dh","gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473776119}
